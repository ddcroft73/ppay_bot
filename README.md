# ppay_bot

A simple bot ran by Selenium that pays an important bill. Missing the payload json. Bot works pretty well, but does not work 100% of the time. Some TimeOut issues and I stopped testing because it will probably cause some interest I don't want. 
Works well enough and will employ with cron to launch once a month.

Not much to say about this. A quick tool to fill a need. I had no prior knowledge of Selenium before I wrote this and I did it in about an hour and a half.

## To Do:
- Learn more about Selinium mostly about waiting and time outs, not sure if im WebDriverWait... ing enough or right.
- Test more and implement a balancer to inform me of what's left to pay.
